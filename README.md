# Cluster

The central goal of Cluster is to be an obsessive slow real-time
strategy game in which the players compete to dominate the galaxy,
but in which no single player has the resources or power to win on
their own, making diplomacy and cooperation key to establishing a
winning alliance or a winning play.

Like many diplomacy games, Cluster games are likely to have their
share of betrayals but I believe the better game experience will
be one that rewards alliance formation and meta-game play so that
the dominant experience of the game is one where players are
challenged to form alliances that win the game, and yet are
incentivised to form alliances with different players each time
ensuring uniqueness and “fairness” for gameplay.

Cluster’s game concepts are meant to be few in number, with richness
of choices and game flavour provided by subtypes within each concept
that create matrices of possibility, exploding the game complexity
or collapsing it as desired by having fewer or more elements of
each type.


Cluster's development is barely started, feel free to start discussions,
log bugs, post patches, or contribute in any way.
